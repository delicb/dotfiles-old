Dotfiles
========

This is my personal dotfiles repository. Feel free to fork it and modify to
suite your needs.

This repo is based on [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) manager
for dotfiles with some additional plugins (like 
[dotbot-golang](https://github.com/delicb/dotbot-golang), which is authored by me,
and [dotbot-brew](https://github.com/d12frosted/dotbot-brew).)

Installation
------------
You need `git` installed initially or you should download zip from github.
After obtaining source, run `./install` script. It will detect system (Linux
and Darwin supported) and load appropriate configuration file.
